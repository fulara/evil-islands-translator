Orc to give, when the First Goblin is near to allow to live. Orc about the Blue Stone on the skin a letter to write where it comes from. Only my letter does not know.

Oh, I can't bear my skin! As the First Goblin disappeared, my orc went to ask for help to return. And the orc on the Bald Island to wind up and beat me hard. They say: "You, Go-Go, now ..." - and some kind of bad word. My forget.

And then take away the orc's money, take away the skin-letter, put it in the chest, and kick me and chase me away. Poor Go-Go! Poor Go-Go! There was a leader, but to become ... this one. Which word is not good.

It looks like itâ€™s about that skin with letters from the chest on Bald Island, very curious. I'll leave it to myself. You will need to give it to Granny Estera so that she can read what is written there.

Well, it's not my fault either. And anyway, I'm now going to throw your trick into the fire - maybe then you will finally get loose?

Yes, you, one-eyed, are completely crazy! What do you think I'm going to play with dolls?
