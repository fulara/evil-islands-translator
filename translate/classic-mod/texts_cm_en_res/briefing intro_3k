However, it is very easy to lose Khatul's trust, and listen to my advice: if he asks to do something or advises not to do something, it is better to do what he needs. Otherwise, your life here will be much more difficult!

He was ill for a long time, our sorcerer, and died shortly before your appearance. We have never been friends with him ... And in general, it is unlikely in the whole wide world that he had at least one friend!
