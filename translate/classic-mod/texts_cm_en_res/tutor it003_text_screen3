In the mod there is a "Random drop of things" - things that they wear, runes, blueprints and spells that they use drop from different mobs. More than 1000 unique items dropped from mobs are enchanted with spells.
   
   In all locations, there are many hidden chests in order to open them, you will need "Sleight of hand" (you can find out the level of the required LR in the console when you enter the location).
   Random things, money and resources fall out of the chests, as well as almost all chests are mined with magic traps (without protection from spells, opening such a chest can kill the player, and the damage can be found in the console when entering the location).
   Each chest has a magical aura that allows you to determine the type of damage from the trap and apply protection in advance. If your character is not a magician, then an increase in HP over the required (5% for each point of HP) will increase the chance of a trap charge to miss the character.
   
   In the world of the game, there are often "Assassins" stabbing in the back (with consequences) from a state of invisibility, which brings a lot of unpredictable moments and hardcore into the game. To prevent a stab in the back, you need to detect the "Assassin" with the "Clairvoyance" spell or playing for the undead (it has the ability to sense living creatures, so this ability will not work on undead killers).
   A wand with the "Clairvoyance" spell is given for completing the quest "Collusion at the Gates" and "Tipping Point" on Gipat. The spell "Heal" with the Pr rune embedded in the armor can completely neutralize single damage.
