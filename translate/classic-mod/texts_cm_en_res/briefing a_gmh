I value my reputation as an intermediary, and therefore I must convey to you information about the mercenaries provided.

Anira is also called a "coward" and for good reason - she cannot stand violence and can give dyru if she smells fried.

Then why is she still offering her services as a mercenary? Not a single sortie is complete without violence!

The fact is that although Anira runs away from skirmishes, she always returns and heals the employer. This tactic has its pros and cons.

Well, she can, while running away, draw even more attention to her person, and then you will either have to shine your heels yourself, or save the would-be doctor.
