#phrase Hero 3
The battle mage is looking for a job. During the years of my service in the Kanian army, I have mastered the magic of lightning well. I can't stand idiots and womanizers, if you decide to paw me, I'll charge me with a lightning bolt right in my forehead. If you need a companion in a military campaign, she is always ready to help.
