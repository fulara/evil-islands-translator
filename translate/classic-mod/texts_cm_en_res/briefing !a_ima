Mira is a good girl, she just likes to embellish a little. For five years we served together with her. She was not the best shooter, but she really won a couple of tournaments, but only because Sergeant Arden was trying to get her lo-lal-no-sti, if you know what I mean.

He's lying about cooking too. For all the time she remembered only that the carcass must be skinned before frying. He owns the magic of farsightedness, it's true. And she sings like a waxwing, for this everyone loved her, it was always fun with her on the way.

That is, you are suggesting a fluffy little girl who can only sing? If I go to the minstrels, I will definitely call her.

Well, the fact that she raises morale is important, you know. And she knows how to shoot. Maybe not the best in Ingos, but in 5 years you can teach a horse to shoot. She also has combat experience, so do not worry, she will take away her money. Her services cost not much - 5000 gold.

I do not know how to bargain and do not intend to. The world is worth its money, so don't be stingy.
