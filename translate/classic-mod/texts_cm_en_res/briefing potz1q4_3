I am the Great Magician Gipat, but even I cannot hold back the hordes of these demonic creatures, and the destruction of Gipat is just a matter of time ...

They destroyed the Village and all my family. Where did these creatures come from?

#phrase Rick 3
Our race was haunted by a curse, which I and At-Zako coped with not so long ago ... We thought we did it ... But I did not take into account the fact that the curse cannot be destroyed - it just changes its form and falls on us again. No wonder, the whole race was unable to deal with it, and we decided that we have a chance. Fools.

#phrase Rick 4
After defeating this monster, we did not notice how in the depths of the dungeons, where the last battle took place, something like a gate was born. When I sensed something was wrong, hordes of demons had already filled the lower hall.

#phrase Rick 5
There was nowhere to wait for help, and there was no time. At-Zako and I began to prepare for the decisive battle, but we underestimated the cunning of these creatures. When At-Zako activated the altar of golems in order to organize a defense at the entrance to the lower hall, one of the demons sneaked into my shelter and killed Lua ... the girl of At-Zako, I did not have time to protect her.

At-Zako, having learned about what had happened, rushed to take revenge in a rage. Then you know what happened.

Is there nothing else we can do?

#phrase Rick 8
I underestimated the threat and lost hope of reviving our race, but there is still a chance to make things right. I can send you back in time using all my strength. This rare knowledge could not be useful to me, since it takes the life of the caster, and my strength is enough to send you only a few months ago.

What should be done?

#phrase Rick 10
After you find yourself in the past, try to find me, and tell me what happened, and now wait quietly, I must concentrate. I have not read this spell before, and a mistake can lead to unintended consequences.
