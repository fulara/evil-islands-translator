Alliance with the Village against a common enemy. The witch doctor Estera had a prophetic dream about the future. An army of demons will invade Gipat and destroy all living things.

Stop laughing, whether you believe it or not is up to you, but the Village offers gold as payment for the union.

Well, gold is, of course, good. However, this will not be enough.

Where can I get it for you on Gipat?

I know where - in the Dead City! Right at the top of the Lonely Mountain it is.

No one has returned from the Dead City yet. Do you want my death?

How is it nobody? And what about the Chosen One? He returned from there with iron weapons. It turns out that not everything is as scary as it seems.

Why can't you handle skeletons? Take something heavier and cut your way: bones are fragile if you have a club.

Well, with skeletons, I think I can handle it.
