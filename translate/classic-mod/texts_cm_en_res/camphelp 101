Spell Shop
The scrolling lists are: at the top, the assortment of the store, at the bottom, your things (baggage). The buttons to the left and right of the lists allow you to sort their contents. There is a counter in the center of the screen. At the bottom left is information about the purchase / sale price. The keys next to it allow you to make a deal or refuse it (all runes will be returned).
