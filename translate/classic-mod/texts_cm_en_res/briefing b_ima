Wow! Lesovik? It's interesting to know how he ended up among your guys. I thought they weren't interested in money.

Money is really unnecessary for them. The money will come in handy for our camp, and the foresters help us out of gratitude.

And how did you get the appreciation of the forestry? I, too, would not mind making such a friendship.

Yes, it's an old thing. Soon after we left the control of Valrasian, he sent a detachment of soldiers to our souls, he wanted to subdue us by force. It would be better if he sold his stupid trinkets and paid the salaries to the people, you puffed-up fool!

Hey, hey, be quiet. He's very close here. I completely agree with you, but such conversations should be conducted outside these walls.

Yes you are right. I got excited. In general, we had our own people in the city, and we learned in advance about this heinous plan of the governor. Our guys attacked their camp at night and in a matter of moments defeated the enemy. Surprisingly, they had two foresters in captivity. The troll will figure out what they wanted to do with them, but we didn't need them either, so the guys let them go.

And after a couple of days, these two forest workers came to our camp. They said that now they owe us for our salvation and are ready to fulfill any of our wishes. Well, we thought, in everyday life they are useless, they refuse to hunt, they have it forbidden, something about harmony and nature. In general, they can only be useful in battle. Now we are providing their military service to pay off the debt.

Yeah. Fate knows how to surprise. I know the foresters firsthand, they are excellent shooters, dangerous creatures. Such a fighter in the unit would be useful to me.

You shouldn't be like that. They are not creatures, very good little ones. In many ways, they are similar to people. As we talked with them closer, we realized that so many stupidities and superstitions of various kinds were invented at their expense, that it was already a shame for our dense souls. And punitive campaigns on the orders of Tilvar, and it hurts to remember, it is we who are in their debt, and not they are with us. Okay, I chatted. Serving Sazar will cost you 15,000 gold.

Yes, they are like us. Slightly into their territory, you will immediately be stuffed with arrows, and they will also treat you with lightning. And it’s for this business that I need him, and so I’ll find someone to chat with. Here's the money.
