Ingos
Ingos belongs to the Empire of Kania, but its territory is very large and the population is small, and therefore tribes of other races still live here. Ingos is divided into several provinces, each of which is governed by a governor with the support of a squad of guards sent from the capital. Nevertheless, the inhabitants of Ingos enjoy great freedom, have an independent character and do not always meekly fulfill the demands of the authorities.
