Spells / Skills
You can use the experience gained by each character while completing tasks to improve skills and acquire skills. You can also give spells to characters or put them in a general train. At the same time, if the stock of strength or knowledge in magic of the selected character is insufficient for some spell, it will not be possible to give it to this character.
