Hello dear! Captain Tilvar advised me to speak to you about a stranger with blond hair. Do you by any chance know where he could have gone?

I know. He searches for the missing princess, as does the detective from the capital hired by the governor Valrasian. This stranger followed the detective to the east of the city's outskirts.

Speaking of the governor, do you know how to get his attention? I urgently need to talk to him.

I could put in a good word for you, but I don't know anything about you ... let's do this: you will do one job for me, and I will arrange a meeting with the governor?

Soon a buyer will come to us, who gives a normal price for skins and rare trophies, not like Kararansul. So, if you get me a werewolf's head and kill a dozen tigers in the outskirts of the city so that it is safe to get skins, I will put in a word for you to the governor.

Werewolf?! What kind of beast is this and where to look for it?

The man who turns into a black wolf at night. Only the wolf is not simple, but very large, and it will not be easy to kill such a person. Where exactly he lives, I will not say, but they say that they saw him in the south of the outskirts of the city.

Okay, I'll try to get you his head and kill the tigers.
