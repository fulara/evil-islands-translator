The chieftain too often got hit on the head, it is not surprising that he forgot me. It's for the best.

What a generosity ... They certainly will not be superfluous, but I still wanted to find a blue stone, but it was not in the cave. What to do next? Granny Estera said that the stone could be brought by the current.

The shape of the blue stone is round, and this usually happens after prolonged exposure to water. If you think about it, groundwater comes from the distant mountains. The stone could well have been brought from there, but lake lizards live there, and without an army I will not poke my head on them.
