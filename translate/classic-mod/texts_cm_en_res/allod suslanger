Suslanger
Suslanger belongs to the Hadagan Empire. The size of Suslanger is small, and there is very little land suitable for life and agriculture. The river that broke through the canyon and flows into the lake is practically the only major source of water. In order to somehow expand the cultivated land, people have to build irrigation canals and dams. The government in Khadagan is harsh and ruthless. Numerous guards punish for the slightest violations of the emperor's decrees, and spies and spies report on every suspicious person.
