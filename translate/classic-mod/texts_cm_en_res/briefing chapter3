Once in the past of Gipat, I needed to get to the Great Magician as soon as possible and tell about the impending danger. But it was impossible to get to him without outside help. So I had to pretend to be a spy for the Free Hunters and work for them. My first assignment was to spy on the Chosen One himself.

The Chosen One ruined the plans for the conquest of the Village by the Hunters, killing the robber Red, thereby incurring the wrath of Ataman. It turned out that my transfer to the past of Gipat did not pass without consequences. I can no longer die - it seems that after death I go back a little back in time. I donâ€™t know if this is good.

The Hunter's assault on the Chosen One failed, and I was unlucky enough to witness this failure, because the Chosen One noticed me too. I had to fight him. Fortunately, I managed to convince him of my innocence.

The Free Hunters suffered heavy losses and left the Chosen One alone. Later it became known to me that the Headman of the Village was behind the attack, who gave the Ataman Babur's apprentice and a lot of gold.

The situation in the Village was heated to the limit, and it was no longer possible for me to stay in it. Suspicions of betrayal forced me to move to the new camp of the Free Hunters. Perhaps here I can find help and get to the Great Magician.
