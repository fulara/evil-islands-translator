I am going to have a serious mess, and without a good doctor I can't take my head off. I'm looking closely at Mildrith, she has impressive combat experience, judging by the announcement.

Ooooh, believe me, if Mildrit is in your squad, then you have nothing to fear. The ogre would sooner break a club on your head than Mildrith would let you get stuck. In the army, everyone called her mother. Mildrit fought for the life of every soldier as if it were her own child.

What troubles she has never been in: ambushes of robbers, trolls, cannibals, even in skirmishes with the forestry! And one day, in the mines that had not yet been abandoned, Captain Brunt disappeared, and Mildrit was in the search party. They went so deep in their search that they stumbled upon wormfaces !!! Oh, as I can imagine, it already throws me into a shiver. However, everyone survived, thanks to Mildrith, and Brant's corpse was found a little further than the battlefield, the troll will take it apart, what he did there.

Eeeeh, expensive of course, but cheaper than a new head.
