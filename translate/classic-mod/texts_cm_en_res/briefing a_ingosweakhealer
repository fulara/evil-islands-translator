#phrase Hero 3
A very talented sorceress healer is looking for adventure, that is, work. In addition to healing, I can make you stronger and faster and lighter and lighter, that is, they will not pierce you with lightning. And you don't have to call me for boring guarding your house or hunting. I want real battles and travels !!
