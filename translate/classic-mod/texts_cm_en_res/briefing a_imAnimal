Nuuu, no, it doesn't breathe fire, but it will tear a man apart, but what is there, a man, a troll will bite.

But his skin is fiery, magical? He's like a revived flame, huh ?!

Well, not really, she's more bright as fire, very beautiful. But if you look from a distance, then just as you say, as if the flame came to life!

So wait, is that just a tiger with a ginger skin?

Where have you seen a tiger with a red skin? This is not just a tiger, he is a magical, nightmare creature of the astral plane!

Enough to feed me with fairy tales! It's just a tiger from a different allod. And you absolutely do not know how to lie.

Eh, your truth. I don't know how to lie, and the tiger is no magic.

I'm very embarrassed. Sorry to have dropped to this level. I would never, but this is such a difficult situation. You see, this tiger was raised and trained in our garrison. And while the governor was paying his salary, he could be supported, and now it is not easy to get food for himself, but even less to feed such a large animal. People did not raise his hand to drive him out, everyone fell in love with him, so they decided to sell him to a man with money, and the proceeds would be divided among the community.

We tried to find a buyer for him, but few people need tigers, and Stripe is also colorful, unusual, people think that he is sick or cursed, and as you correctly noted, he probably comes from another allod. Then one buffoon with a long tongue turned up for us, he wrote to us for a bottle of this nonsense for the announcement. I immediately said that this was a stupid idea, but I had no choice, I find work for the guys from the camp and I had to look for a buyer for Polosatik.

No, I understand everything, it is not humanly to put your beloved pet on the street, and that it is not easy for people to survive now. But I don't need a pet, especially for such money.

I am of course to blame, and I regret it. But Polosatik is not a domestic kitten, he is a trained, fighting tiger, no worse than those of Bald, and much more disciplined, he was trained by our garrison dog. He is faster than a horse, his fangs are so large and sharp that they bite through armor. The wounds on him heal so quickly that sometimes you think that he may be truly magical. Believe me, he will be your loyal companion and a dangerous enemy for your enemies.

The tiger is a terrible beast, it's true. But 15,000, and even after such a presentation. Throw off to 10,000 and from hand to hand.

Ahhh, troll with him, with gold. In some century I will help people, otherwise everything for myself, yes for myself. Take it for it, just take care of him properly.
