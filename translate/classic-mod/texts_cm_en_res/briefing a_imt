I liked Norman. Judging by the announcement, he has no experience.

Yes, Norman is a great guy, he was more in the service than I was. He loves only 2 things in life: fighting and drinking. I remember that it was a poor year for game, he and a couple of other guys went hunting, there was no game, and Norman got drunk out of boredom.

Everyone is already going back. And then they hear Norman's voice: "Prepare arrows, drive, drive!" Everyone stands up and waits satisfied, and after a couple of moments they see a hefty evil troll and Norman, fleeing from him. They ran away from him for half an hour, then we laughed with the whole garrison, ha-ha-ha!

Something I'm not sure anymore that I need it.

Come on, he's a great fighter. Why do you think they kept him in the service for so long, always oblique? Without him, not a single punitive campaign against the gangs was complete. Just don't let him drink. However, he waves his sword just as well under the drunkenness.

Come on then, after the case, I'll pay him in the tavern with a couple of bottles of beer.

You don't have to mock my guys, either pay 5,000 or get out of here before I get pissed off.
