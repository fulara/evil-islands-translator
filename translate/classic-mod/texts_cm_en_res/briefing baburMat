I am still very far from your skill level, and I simply don’t have time to do it so hard, so you don’t have to worry about it.

Outside of Gipat, there are other materials that can be used to create armor: Cloth and Metal.
It is better not to consider fabric as armor, but almost any spells can be inserted into it.
Metal: You have to find out for yourself.
