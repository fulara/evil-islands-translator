Thank you! At first I was not aware of your existence. But now, knowing that there is such a strong Dragon on Gipat, I cannot but ask you for help.

The fact is that powerful demons will soon attack Gipat. Even the Great Magician himself will not be able to deal with them if I do not find allies who will help us.

Well, that was reasonable enough reasoning - for a human. Perhaps you should try to leave Gipat and seek help in other lands.

This is exactly what I'm going to do. The Great Magician has already figured out how to bring people from other lands. It remains only to unite everyone on Gipat and clear the path to the gorge in the Far Mountains from the lizards.

Lizards guard a meteorite hidden under water. I need it as proof: having learned about it, people from other lands will flock to Gipat, like flies to ... In general, it will not take long to convince them.

I am afraid that if you do not help us, then all life on Gipata will perish.
