They put me behind bars, but the Chosen One pulled me out and I had to flee the city. Now I am outlawed and hiding with the green clan forestry. There I met a detective who told me that the Chosen One had also saved him.

Now we are together trying to find those who attempted the detective, since most likely they are associated with the disappearance of the red-skinned girl, whom the Chosen One and the detective want to save.

Once we save her, the detective will help me with a message and we can return to Gipat. While our search has led us to the Domain of Karansul, from where we have to look for the trail of those who tried to kill the detective.
