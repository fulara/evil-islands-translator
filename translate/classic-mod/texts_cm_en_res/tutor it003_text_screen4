There are storylines from a variety of quests. Profile quests: for example, the quest on Suslanger "With one blow" this quest can only be completed by a character with the "stab in the back" perk pumped to the maximum and will receive a unique spell as a reward. (and many other quests for different classes) Quests are issued by different characters (on Gipata in the Village there are 8 questgivers: Rivar, Airi, Voevoda, Estera, Tka-Rik, Mama, Yar and Pig).
   For the convenience of the players, a "Quest Board" was created located at the exit from the settlement. "Quest Board" shows tasks suitable for your character in terms of difficulty (+ -25% progress relative to yours). Select an assignment and a dialogue with the employer will start automatically. If the task is in another location, then the character will automatically be transferred to it, and the task must already be hit directly (usually in such locations there are 3-4 tasks and it will not be difficult to find them).

   To switch to the next allods, it is necessary that the progress indicator of the current allod be equal to 100%. The progress indicator increases from completing quests. The amount of progress, experience and gold received for a task is influenced by the complexity of the message board, the difference between your progress and the difficulty of the task
   The console contains a lot of information that can be useful. For example, by going to the quest map and opening the console, you will see information: Chances of dropping unique items and runes; drop chance multipliers from bosses and chests; the chances of a drop of runes; the required number of the "Sleight of hand" parameter to open chests at the current location; damage of traps, which are charged with all chests in the location.
