Upon learning of the impending danger, the Great Magician revealed to me the location of the fallen meteorite - the very blue stone that I had to search for for so long. Having obtained a piece of the meteorite, with its help I can lure people from other lands to Gipat. Hopefully this will help us fight back the demons.
