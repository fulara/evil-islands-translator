Add / remove server in the address book
For more convenience, you can remember
server in its address book. These servers
will always be in the list (highlighted
orange).
Add server to address book: on click
on the "Add / Remove" button a window will appear for
entering / editing the server address. If this
moment one of the running
servers, its address will appear in the window.
Remove server: select a server in the address book
and click on the "Add / Remove" button.

You can also play with this even
when the master server is dead. Just connect
to your favorite IP. If your ping is 9999 then use
Hamachi program or its equivalent. How to use this
the program is described in great detail by me on
forum of our clan http://honestgroup.net/
