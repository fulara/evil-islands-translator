Previously, she was fluent in fire magic, which is where her middle name came from - Fire Fox. Although, maybe it was just the color of her hair ... It doesn't matter.

But once in one battle she was thoroughly hit on the head, after which she imagined herself to be "Robin Gad". Behind her eyes, everyone calls her "Kylie-muff" - it's not hard to guess why. The nickname "muff" exactly reflects her skill with small arms.

In general, the girl is not bad. Perhaps she just lacks experience.
