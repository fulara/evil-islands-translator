Oh Great Magician, I am here with disturbing news ...

(cough) I'm sorry ... it's not every day that guests from the future come to me, and even from such a gloomy one.

Can you read minds? Then I don't need to talk about my past, you already know everything.

And in order to save Gipat, I will need your help.

How can I help?

We will have to seek help in other lands. I myself am attached to Gipat and I cannot help you with this, but I can send you there in my power.

Who in their right mind would want to help us at the risk of their lives?

That's right, that's why you will have to lure as many soldiers from other lands as possible to Gipat by cunning, and I know how this can be done.

The Khadagan expedition, which you and your chosen one exterminated, were looking for a fallen meteorite, and they were not that far from their goal. The meteorite lies in front of my dwelling under water and is surrounded by lizards that do not favor anyone.

So that's where the blue stone that I had to look for earlier on Gipata came from.

Yes, you will need a hefty chunk of this meteorite as proof for the outsiders. Having learned that there is material on Gipat, from which they make their best armor, they will not have to wait long, they will want to get it.

How can I get a piece of this meteorite? It is underwater and is guarded by blue dragons.

#phrase Rick2 14
On especially hot days, the water in the reservoir decreases, and the meteorite becomes visible, and you have to deal with the lizards.

Teleportation of the Chosen One to Ingos took a lot of my strength and in order to send you - I will need time and rest.

What's up with the Chosen One? Is it more important than the demonic invasion of Gipat?
#CAMERA 3
#phrase Rick2 17
The Chosen One on Gipata no longer has any business, unlike you. As I recuperate, you must unite everyone you can against the impending threat.

But the Chosen One could help me ...

Unlike you, he can be killed, and besides, you should not change the future - this can turn into disastrous consequences. Based on your memories, he completed his task.

I also need to study your ability to return to the past after death, and for this, if you will, I will take some of your blood.

Please, would like to know how it works and when it will stop saving my life.

First of all, I will go to the healer and try to convince her to return to the Village. She knows what awaits us and will help in uniting the inhabitants of Gipat.
