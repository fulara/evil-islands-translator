Many spells have been reworked (for example, Strengthen, Weaken and Eagle's Eye have an Effect modifier, i.e. they can not only be prolonged, but also enhanced).

   The "action" perk is now much more useful. affects the speed of witchcraft (dementia, healing, mass spells), and not only the speed of strikes and fire.
 
   Runes of speed have appeared in the mod, which increase the speed of casting spells.
   
   After the release and implementation of the new version of the addon (one of the gimmicks for the operation of network mods), all attacks of units and heroes are no longer limited to animation of movements and the "Actions" parameter no longer has a limit. Initially, everyone attacks very slowly, but there are no more breaks between attacks, in the subsequent development of the character, the speed of attacks increases noticeably.
