Is that all you wanted to tell me?

You are in a hurry again. I remember your questions and I will answer them. Now I need you to return the water to the canal. The orcs have stolen the water from us.

Head south along the water. You will see the dam and the canal. The dam must be raised. Lever. I'll give it. The channel needs to be filled up. Stone. I will not give a stone. He is already at the edge of the canal. Upstream of the dam. The stone is heavy. When the orcs dug, they lifted it for a long time. If you push him, he will fall back quickly.

Then come back and I will give you the gold that I have.

Hmm ... Gold - it certainly won't hurt, but there is something else you could help me with. There is a tribe of lake lizards in the Far Mountains, could you agree with them so that they let me in to ... a piece of blue stone that lies in a gorge under water?

They don't like to talk. They don't like anything at all. Only kill.

In that case, I could use the help of your more accommodating relatives to clear the way to the gorge. You will help?

Actually, I wanted to joke, otherwise you're too serious.

Understand. This is a joke. I guess I can joke too. Later.

Deal! And by the way, if you add a few coins, I will not be offended at all.

#phrase Oliz 15
Go to my kinsmen who live in the shallows further south for coins. Go to the farthest sandy island, the third in a row. The treasure will be yours!

Itâ€™s strange. This person loves humor. I was kidding. The man didn't laugh. Very strange.
