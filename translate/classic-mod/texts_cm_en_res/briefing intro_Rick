Earlier, in search of my Jun tribesmen, I did not think about people of other races at all!

But by the cruel irony of fate in my blindness, I did not recognize the one I was looking for, although he was standing next to me, and his true appearance was hidden by a simple spell!

Not recognizing him, I sent the young june to Suslanger, practically to certain death. And I was surprised when he finally managed to return. And amazed when he found out who he really is.

But I'm not going to repeat my mistakes. I am glad to greet the heroes who are not indifferent to the fate of Gipat.

A formidable danger looms over Gipat, and I need strong and loyal people to ward off it.

#phrase Rick 7
The Khadagan Empire is preparing an invasion of Gipat, a huge army is gathering at the portal on Suslanger! I am powerful enough to repel the enemy here, but after that Gipat will turn into a scorched desert.

It will be better if you can weaken the army on Suslanger. Better yet, help make the invasion impossible. Peace be on the land of Gipat!
