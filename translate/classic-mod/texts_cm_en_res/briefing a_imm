Hi, I need a battle mage, but this Yaznis seems like a grumpy woman. I would not like to receive a lightning bolt because she did not like the stew or a supposedly displeased look.

Yaznis is an experienced soldier and will not throw tantrums over some nonsense. But as for flirting, jokes and other things, it is better not to pester her with this. And all this applies only to men, she does not tolerate them. In her youth, she was badly burned a couple of times.

And how did she even serve in the army? More than half of the soldiers are men.

And where are they not, men? And hatred just needs to be directed in the right direction. Show Yaznis the dirty bandit, she will incinerate him with her eyes, ha-ha !! Guys do not like her, of course, they call her an ulcer behind her back, her name is suitable, it is worth admitting, but they respect her for magical skills.

Yeah, an interesting woman. This means that the peasants should not be allowed to her, not joking, talking only about business.

Well, in general, yes. She is a good soldier, and if you wanted love, go to the tavern, there are many passionate women, and it will be cheaper. Her help will rise to you at 5000.
