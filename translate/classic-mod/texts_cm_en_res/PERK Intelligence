Mind
The mind affects how much experience the character receives for completing tasks (the higher the mind, the more experience gained). Also, the mind affects the consumption of the reserve of forces when using spells (the higher the mind, the lower the cost). In addition, such a parameter as "knowledge of magic" depends on the mind.
