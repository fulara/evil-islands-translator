Glad you got out of town. Call me Zach. I was called the Chosen One on Gipat, but now it's superfluous.

One hunter from a northwestern settlement in the vicinity of the city. He said, they say, he saw how the red-skinned girl was led towards the settlement of miners in the east.

He is dressed in fur armor and was carrying a bow. I think it won't be difficult to recognize him.

After the assassination attempt on the detective, I chased the intruder, but could not catch up. The tracks end in Kharansul's Domain.

Since the tracks lead to the Domain of Karansul, it means that we will have to look for clues there.
