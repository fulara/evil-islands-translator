City outskirts
In this province of Ingos, there is only one city, which is the seat of power. The population of the villages around is hostile to the city dwellers because of the ruinous orders of the governor. Also in the district there are creatures who are called foresters according to their habitat. Their interests rarely overlap with those of people.
