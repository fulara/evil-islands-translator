Spell
The spell can be embedded in a weapon or armor. The spell must contain a rune ("Pp" or "Pr") that determines how the spell will work. The item has limitations on the difficulty and the amount of spell energy that can be put into it. If this item is later disassembled, the spell can be retrieved and cast normally.
