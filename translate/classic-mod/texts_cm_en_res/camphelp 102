Item constructor
When designing, you can use both items in the wagon train and items from the store's assortment (their price will be taken into account). You can collect items (using blueprints and materials) or disassemble existing ones. At the bottom of the left window there is information about the price of assembly / disassembly. The buttons next to it allow you to either perform an action or refuse it.
