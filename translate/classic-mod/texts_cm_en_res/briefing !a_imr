What kind of bandit on your team is Scar? I never looked like a soldier.

Yes, a filthy robber. People say that he used to be in the gang of Brutus the Ripper. After a successful raid on Karansul's caravan, they did not share the loot and took up arms, as is their custom. Scar was lucky to escape, but in the fight he received many wounds, one of which was a terrible scar on the half of his face.

Others say that he lived in the Baldish family, began to steal from his own, and tigers were lowered on him, which left a mark on his face. In any case, a dirty crook.

I see you don't like him. What then are you helping him?

I owe him my life, so I pay the bills. One night, returning home from a tavern, some bastard attacked me, put a knife to my throat, took my purse and began to look sideways. I understand that now he will cut my throat so that I will not surrender him to the guard. But then behind him, as if out of nowhere, Scar appeared, knocked the knife out of his hand and let's beat him. But the nimble bastard turned out to be and ran away.

Scar returned my wallet and asked if I knew where a dashing guy like him could make money. I, of course, hate all this rabble of thieves, after all, I laid down 12 years of my life, protecting the inhabitants of Ingos from people like him, but from a purely human point of view I owe him. And I no longer have fighters with such skills.

It's amazing that he just didn't kill the guy that attacked you, and he returned the money, generous bandit.

Apparently, he is not so lost. In short, his help will cost you 5,000 gold. Interested in?

An adult woman, but naive as a child. Scar knew exactly who she was, and what had to be done to get into trust. What's the difference? I just want a quiet killer, and she doesn't need to know the whole truth.
