Abandoned mines
Mining was once developed in this area. But after monsters and monsters began to appear in the mines, the entrances to them were closed - and the surroundings fell into disrepair. Now there are very few people living in this territory, and they do not feel somehow obliged to fulfill the demands of the city authorities.
