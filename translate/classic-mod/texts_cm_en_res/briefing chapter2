It all started quite harmlessly: after completing a couple of tasks in the Village, I was assigned an important task - to take a letter to my father in Sredniye Gory.

On the way to the camp, I met a group of demonic creatures that were burning all living things. It was lucky that Estera's grandmother gave me an elixir that made me invisible to the forest lights. It turned out that the demons had the same instinct, and therefore did not notice me. But the rest were less fortunate - the demons killed my father and all my loved ones.

Despair overtook me. Not knowing what to do, my eyes turned to the letter. It said that the healer Estera had a dream about caves in the Far Mountains, and they asked my father to find out what was happening there. I had no choice but to go there.

The cave turned out to be the refuge of the Great Magician, who tried to repel the demons. But he had no chance - there were too many critters.

The Great Magician noticed me at the last moment and managed, at the cost of his life, to send me to the past of Gipat in order to change the future. Now I have to find him to warn of the impending threat.
