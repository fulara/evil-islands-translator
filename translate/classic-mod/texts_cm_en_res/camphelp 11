Items: purchasable
When you select items from the store's assortment, they are laid out on the counter. The top two rows of the counter contain the items you are about to buy. The bottom two are the ones you intend to sell. At the bottom left, near the counter, there are buttons by which you can make an act of purchase / sale or refuse it.
