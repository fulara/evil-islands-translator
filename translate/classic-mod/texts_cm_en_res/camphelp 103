Spell constructor
You can use the basics and runes when designing both from the wagon train and from the store (their price will be taken into account). You can collect spells using foundations and runes (the latter are optional), or disassemble existing ones. At the bottom of the left window there is information about the price of assembly / disassembly. The buttons next to it allow you to either perform an action or refuse it.
