Welcome to our Village. I didn't live here before, but everything changes once. Rivar and I met when I wanted to steal… uh… borrow some healing herb from an orc shaman near the village.

Well, in general, I had to get away until I ran into Rivar.

Yes, if you need work, come to me with Rivar, we will give you a chance to prove yourself.
