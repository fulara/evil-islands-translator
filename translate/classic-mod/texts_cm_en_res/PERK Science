Sleight of hand
A skill that allows you to open locks, operate with unknown mechanisms, and steal things unnoticed. Sleight of hand is skill based and depends on "dexterity". The higher this skill, the more complex devices the character can use and the higher the likelihood that the enemy will not notice the theft.
