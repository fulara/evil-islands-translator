Two rivers
This area got its name from the two rivers flowing through it. There used to be a large city in the interfluve, but the war turned it into ruins, and the dead inhabitants turned into undead. The place between these rivers is of a strategic nature, therefore a powerful Khadagan camp is located in the ruins.
