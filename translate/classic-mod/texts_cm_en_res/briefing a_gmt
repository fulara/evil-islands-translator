Listen, I'll tell you now. It was like this, being drunk as hell, he decided to go to the outhouse for the night looking and sat down not far from a bunch of goblins guarding the bridge.

Well, the goblins either heard something, or smelled it, by the outgoing smell, in general, a picture appeared before us: Valeer was running with his pants down from a pack of goblins. We laughed for a long time with this asshole.

Well, heâ€™s a good guy so he can cover your back in case of danger.
