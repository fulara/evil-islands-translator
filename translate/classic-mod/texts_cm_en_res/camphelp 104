Fixing an item
In the process of use, the reliability of any item decreases. When it becomes zero, the item deteriorates and cannot be used. To restore the reliability of an item, it must be repaired. At the bottom of the left window is information about the cost of the repair. The buttons next to it allow you to either perform an action or refuse it.
