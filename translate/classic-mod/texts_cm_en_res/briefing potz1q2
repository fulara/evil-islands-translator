I told him this, and I overheard the conversation of the vigilantes. Orcs were said to have attacked the patrol near the Caverns in the Foothills. So, the shaman was not among them, and fiery arrows from nowhere fell upon ours.

More like a planned attack than an accident.

I'm heading to the Foothills for mushrooms, so I can look into the Cave - maybe I can find out something. Friends will be surprised when a cake comes from nowhere.
