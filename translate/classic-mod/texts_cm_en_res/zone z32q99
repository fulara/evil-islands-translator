Death island
The island was once used by Kania as a sea hub, the old marina and abandoned warehouses have survived to the present day. Now a powerful necromancer has settled here, due to which half of the island has become dead. In the dragon mountains, a statue of a hero - a vampire slayer - stands as a symbol of freedom.
