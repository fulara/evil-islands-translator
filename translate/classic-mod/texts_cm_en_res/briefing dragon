Damn it! The chieftain said nothing about the hefty dragon. Here is a bastard.

I apologize for disturbing you, and it was not in your thoughts to disturb you. I was told that here I could get an iron weapon, but nothing was said about the dragon.

The man was looking for a weapon, but he came to me. What am I to do with you now?

Alas, this is impossible. I respect traditions, and according to them, you cannot just leave.

You can challenge me to battle. You can demand the release of the girl. Finally, you can claim a task for yourself. I have no girls in captivity now.

It is unlikely that I will overcome this whopper, although you can take the risk ... But first you need to find out what kind of task, and then we will see.

This area is all permeated with caves, and there, below, nasty creatures live and breed. When night falls, their cubs climb up and even climb into my den. They annoy me.

Find and kill the womb of these creatures, and do not return before that. Although, I confess to you honestly, I can't believe that you can.
