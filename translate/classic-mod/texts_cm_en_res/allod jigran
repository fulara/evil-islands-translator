Jigran
Jigran is the world of eternal autumn, the arena of confrontation between the last two great empires - Khadagan and Kania. Fading and death reign on this land - the result of the monstrous spells of the insane necromancer Firesis. From the once flourishing land, evil sorcery pulled out almost all the forces: the fields will not give birth, the forests are dying, the beast has almost disappeared. The population of the allod is mainly concentrated in fortified cities, while the space outside the walls is at the mercy of various creatures and undead, which can be found more often than living creatures. This is a closed world, lost in time and space.
