Following the guardian of the blue clan, we arrived at their camp, where we met the knight Brissen. His goal is to help the green clan and kill the scout who is somewhere in the human camp. The camp is well guarded and it is not easy to get there.

We help foresters and at the same time find out where the one we are looking for is. Having enticed this person and having received the necessary information, we will find out who the "customer" is. Zack takes on this task and finds out where Jun's girlfriend is hiding, and I help the blue clan and the knight Brissen.
