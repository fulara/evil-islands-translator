It seems that our Village will never get rid of the neighborhood with robbers! No matter how much I made plans, I cannot completely destroy them! But now I have a new good idea.
#phrase Hero 2
Hmm ... Actually, when they say the words "new good idea" in front of me, I immediately expect some kind of catch!
#phrase Nsheriff 3
No catch! I just want to ask you to take the loot from the robbers. You don't even have to fight them, because the main goal is a bag of gold that they have in their camp.

True, the approaches to the camp are guarded, but the guards can be deceived.
