Dar Ulgorn Fortress
This fortress belonged to Cania, but not so long ago it had to be abandoned. The fortress of Dar Ulgorn was occupied by the Khadagan warriors, and the surroundings were ravaged. Only ghouls work in the fields, as the necromancers zombified all the peasants. These ghouls provide food for the garrison.
