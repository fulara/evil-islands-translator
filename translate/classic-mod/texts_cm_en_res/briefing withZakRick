Your unusual appearance here has attracted my attention. And having managed to look into the Magic Ball, you interested me even more. My dragon baby accompanied you everywhere, and as far as I know, at times you even noticed him. And the closer to success your search was, the more I looked forward to our meeting.

But who are you? What's your name? And if you are so powerful that you could watch me without leaving your cave, will you agree to help my trouble? After all, I probably don't need to tell you about her - you already know everything ...

You ask all the questions at once and ill-considered. Aren't you afraid that I will do the same with the answers? However, your curiosity will be partially satisfied.

My name will sound to you like Tka-a-Litan Rich-ti-a-Nick. For an impatient person like you, this is probably unnecessarily long. Therefore, call me short: Tka-Rik. If you want, you can add the words "Great Magician" to this name, but I myself do not need such solemnity.

I have no time for jokes, not at all. Everything in the world has a price, and I pay it in full. None of the Great Mages have the right to leave their island - here I am chained to the abandoned Gipat. Therefore, I need a person who can complete my assignment on another land.

You will have to find and deliver two young people here, a boy and a girl. They, like me, belong to the once great June race, and I need ... However, I will tell you about this later, if you wish. Now tell me: do you agree?

When the world was one, Gipat was only part of a vast continent. After the power of the Juns dried up, states of other races appeared here.

The Night of Trouble, the catastrophe that split the world, destroyed these countries: fewer traces of them remained than from the long-forgotten Juns. Only two empires survived the Night of Troubles, two eternal rivals: Kania and Khadagan.

Kania, where you have to go, seems to me a country where rulers do not show excessive cruelty, and their subjects feel quite free. But don't give in to the temptation to relax and don't get out of hand!

With the power of my magic, I will send you to Ingos. My amulet will help you to return, but it will only work when the girl is found!

Get ready: you will feel dizzy, and when you come to your senses, another earth will already be spreading around. My baby dragon will accompany you ... And may your luck follow you just as relentlessly!
